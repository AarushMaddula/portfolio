  "description": "In this project, we were tasked with building and coding a Lego Rail-Mounted Robot designed to carry an object with a small mass to a designated spot, drop it, and go back to its starting position. This robot would be mounted on a PVC pipe with black tape on both ends of the pipes and three different color tapes in the middle, marking the designated dropping spots.",

      "description": "I proposed two designs: one with wheels holding PVC pipes from top and bottom, and another with four side wheels, a top brick, using a color sensor to detect colors. Clarence suggested a design with the baseplate on the top and a wheel on the bottom of the pipe to drive the robot, as well as a design with multiple side wheels for better stability. Jacob proposed a design with a wheel on the top of the pipe driving the robot. We compromised on a design with side wheels with the brick on top and the sensor underneath for reliable color detection.",

We designed our wheels to grip the side of the PVC pipe so that the corners of each wheel would contact the pipe. The sensor is on the bottom center of the robot, allowing for consistent color detection regardless of the direction it’s going in.",

We did this by creating a speed variable that keeps track of the current direction of the robot with negative and positive signs indicating the direction. When the robot detects the black tape, we multiply the speed variable by -1 to change the direction of the robot. The robot stops checking the tape for 0.5 seconds so it doesn’t immediately detect the black tape again and get stuck.",

For this task, we didn’t need to make major changes. However, we decided to change the underside of the robot to make it easier to  remove the robot from the pipe. Also, when the robot was traveling along the pipe, the robot would flip over since the robot was top-heavy, so we decided to turn our robot around to stop the robot from flipping each time.",

For example, 0 marks no colors visited, 1 mark 1 color visited, 2 marks 2 colors visited, etc. We then set up an if statement checking if the robot is over the color that the robot is currently on in the current stage as dictated by hasVisited. If so, it stops for 5 seconds, increments hasVisited by 1, and resumes. The behavior with the black tape is maintained.\n\nWe then changed our code to use function blocks, which take in the position that color is in the pattern (for example, blue is in position 1 since it's the first color it stops at) and check to see if the robot is over the color in the current stage. If so, it stops for 5 seconds, increments hasVisited by 1, and resumes. The behavior with the black tape is maintained.",

Afterward, the robot has to return to the end wall, stopping between 5-20 cm from the wall. \n\nWe took the code from Task 3 and added the drop function to it. In the beginning, we created three variables that kept track of how many times the robot visited each color. The forever loop continuously checks to see if it visited a color twice. If it has, then it drops the ball and enters another forever loop inside the if statement. Inside this loop, the robot runs until the distance sensor detects if the robot is close to the wall. If it is, then it stops. The forever loop still makes the robot turn around once it detects the black tape.",
